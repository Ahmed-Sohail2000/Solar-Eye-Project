## Project Scope and Objectives üéØ

A multi-class classification problem in which the scope of the project is to classify whether solar panels whether are clean, dusty, cracked, damaged, bird dropping, and snow using deep learning. This project is inspired and referenced by a journal article called [Fault Detection in Solar Energy Systems using Deep Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/21/4397). The solareye project falls under the Computer Vision category in Deep Learning and will implement CNN model architecture.

The journal article uses 19 pre-trained CNN models such as `EfficientB0`, `ResNet`, `AlexNet`, etc. Along with that, `SVM` and `NCA` was used to classify 12 different classes of solar thermal images of around 20,000 images that was captured by UAV systems.

The overall conclusion of the article mentioned the use of `Efficientb0` pre-trained CNN model and this project will utilize CNN models as well.

The project objectives would be to:

  1. Get the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/code/madenenivamsikrishna/fault-detection-using-resnet50-with-83-accuracy/input
  2. Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
  3. Data Preprocessing & feature engineering
  4. Create a CNN model
  5. Use a pre-trained model and adjust it to our dataset (optional)
  6. Train the model
  7. Evaluate the model
  8. Test the model by predicting it on a random image.
