# Solar Eye üåûüëÄ

## Project Scope and Objectives üéØ

A multi-class classification problem to classify the faults of solar pv modules using UAV drones and deep learning model.

This project aims to develop an AI-driven system that utilizes drone technology to capture images or videos of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules for the purpose of predicting and classifying faults. The integration of AI with drone imagery can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of solar panel inspections, leading to improved maintenance and operational reliability.

The solareye project falls under the Computer Vision category in Deep Learning and will implement CNN model architecture.

The study employs computer vision techniques to detect various errors in solar cell manufacture usingthe YOLOv8 architecture; this new technique can address the drawbacks of conventional detection techniques,including their rigidity, slowness, and reduced accuracy. The experimental findings prove that the proposed approach can effectively and accurately detect numerous defaults that are present on solar cell surfaces, short-circuit, fracture, and horizontal dissolution.

The objectives of the project would be:

**Automate Inspections:** Replace manual inspections with drone-based automated systems, reducing labor costs and time.

**Enhance Accuracy:** Achieve >90% accuracy in fault detection and classification using AI models.

**Increase Efficiency:** Reduce inspection time by 50% compared to traditional methods.

**Provide Actionable Insights:** Deliver detailed reports to maintenance teams for timely repairs.
